# Twinter

The idea of this app is that people can paste their own twitter profile, image they want to convert to NFT that they want their followers to get, and go.

## Steps

1. Paste your twitter profile username.
2. Upload the image you want to convert to NFT.
3. Set the limit of minting (1-N).
4. Wait for someone to follow you.
5. They receive that image as an NFT when they follow you.
